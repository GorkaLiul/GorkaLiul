- 👋 Hi, I’m @GorkaLiul
- 👀 I’m interested in developing 3d applications, meeting people and joining openSource projects :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++ for 3d applications with openGl and some python for fun
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kind of c++ projects (specially if they refer to 3d related projects) (applications/libraries)
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to contact me at @gorkaliul@gmail.com 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him but you can call me by my name (Liul)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I wanted to join the openSource community to meet people with my same interests so I don't have to bother my mother with things she doesn't know about lmao
